						Our place is a private, affordable stand-alone guest house centrally located just minutes to French Quarters, downtown, the Fair Grounds(Jazz Fest) and City Park. The guest house is a quaint, 400 square ft. with a full bath, mini kitchen, '\&' living room. The extra high ceilings make the home fell more spacious. The sofa converts to a bed also. We hace a hand made counter area that adds character to the room an a great counter area that adds character to the room and a great porch/deck to relax on and have a glass of Merlot.

								<h3>From Max the 15th January 2017</h3>
								<p>Fantastic place. It was clean, Adrienne was great (even though we did no meet in person) and everything went super smooth. Location is also great if you like running and something a bit more quiet. I would suggest a car or take into consideration that you might have to Uber into the city from the location. Overall, would recommend the place anytime.</p>

								<h3>From Ignacio the 15th January 2020</h3>
								<p>Great place to stay if you already know Cartagena and want to relax at the beach or in the building. Transportation can be an issue if you are not familiar with the city and there aren't many restaurants/stores around. Make sure you buy food/water/beverages.</p>
